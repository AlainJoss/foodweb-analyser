    "# $R_{\\alpha}$: Measuring Robustness in Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I provide an implementation of $R_{\\alpha}$ for directed graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is $R_{\\alpha}$\n",
    "$R_{\\alpha}$ quantifies the robustness of a graph, particularly useful to assess the stability of ecological networks, such as food webs. Formally, it reflects the relative amount of primary extinctions necessary for the network to reduce to $\\alpha %$ of its original size. Secondary extinctions occur when species are left without any inward-edge. Hence, $R_{\\alpha} \\leq \\alpha$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Analysis\n",
    "A high level overview of the steps performed by the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05); padding:10px 0;font-family:monospace;\">\n",
    "while size > alpha * original size <br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; primary extinction = random node <br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neighbors = neighbors of primary extinction <br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remove primary extinction from graph <br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while there are neighbors <br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if in-degree of neighbor == 0 <br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; save neighbor of neighbors <br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remove neighbor from graph <br>\n",
    "return current graph size / original graph size <br>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the actual implementation the algorithm is more complex. It uses different lists to save its states and returns some of them with r50. The search for secondary extinctions is performed on iteratively on the k-th distance-level-neighbors of the primary extinction, until no removals have to be done. More details in the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the worst case, the input graph is a complete directed graph, such that the running time of the algorithm is in $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$, where $n$ is the amount of nodes in the graph. The algorithm performs fairly well on graphs with lower connectance, because the search .\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "- Basal nodes can be removed, but are never part of a secondary extinction, because they're not successors of any specie.\n",
    "- No rewiring of connections is performed.\n",
    "- It is possible that the graph disconnets. This happens if a cycle gets isolated from the rest of the network. We assume isoltated cycle, which no longer receive energy from any basal nodes to be valid, and to not die out.\n",
